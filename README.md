# SpotifyClone
Developed a Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring interactive music selection and playback controls.
This project leverages JavaScript to enable seamless navigation through tracks, including options to play, pause, and skip forward or backward, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience similar to the original Spotify platform.
